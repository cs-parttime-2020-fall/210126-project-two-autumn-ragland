# 21 01 26 HTML CSS JS Project Two

## Project Description
The goal of this project is to build and deploy a clicking game that utilizes DOM events and conditional logic. You will give a 10 minute presentation on Thursday 01/28 at 6:00 PM walking the class through your final site and speaking to one thing that you found difficult and one thing that you especially like about your site. You will also be asked a few coding questions about your solution. Following presentations the class will walk through the steps to host the site using [github pages](https://pages.github.com/). Your project will be graded using the rubric listed in the resources section below. 

## Project Requirements

### Documentation
- Drawn wireframe of the application pushed to the project repository before starting development
- Bulleted list of detailed, student defined requirements pushed to the project repository before starting development
- A link to your deployed site added to the read me and pushed to the project repository after presentations

### Content
You must have the following content to meet the project requirements but you are welcome to add more appropriate to how you'd like your page to look! A video walk through of an example solution is included in the resources section. Do not directly imitate the styling/layout of this example.

Use grid display to layout three distinct elements : an element to display player one's score and a button to update player one's score, an element to display player two's score and a button to update player two's score, and an element to display the player currently in the lead based on each player's score. Use bootstrap styling throughout your page.

When a button is clicked in either player element the score of that element should increase by one. The player listed in the lead should change as one player's score is higher than the other. If players have the same score "TIE" should be displayed in place of a player name. When either player reaches the number 10 the player in the lead should be alerted in the browsers and scores should clear, restarting the game.

### Bonus

The following requirements are bonus options. Do not attempt the following requirements until you have completed the required content listed above.

The element to display the plyer currently in the lead can also include two additional options : buttons to change the color of player's current score and buttons to change the winning number.

If a player chooses a different color option the color of that counter should be updated to the chosen color. If a player chooses a new winning number a winning player should be alerted and the game should be reset at the chosen number instead of the default winning number, 10.
